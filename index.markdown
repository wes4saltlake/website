## Why is Wes Running?

<img class="img-right" src="assets/wes.jpeg">
Wes Long is running to help our county flourish during a unique and challenging period of our history. As our communities continue to grow and complex issues demand our attention, it is high time we came together and seek out ways to better live with one another.

The Salt Lake County Council is but one of many important ways to make happier, healthier communities a reality. With your support and guidance, Wes believes that we can have a seat at that table.‚Äù

## What Wes Believes 

Wes believes that we are all the government, and as such, we are better off when we participate and keep our community affairs accessible and honest. 

Wes believes that the way we plan our cities has an enormous impact on how well we function and relate to one another, whether we are building a house, planning a park, or preserving our historical landmarks.

Wes believes that life is better when we remember the common good and savor the bonds we forge with one another, including animal life.

Wes believes that the heart and soul of our communities are our working class, which embraces both those with a steady job and those who experience poverty/homelessness. Anything that strengthens our working class strengthens the entire community.

Wes listens and truly considers what others have to say. He strives for thoroughness and seeks to learn as much as he can. He loves people and enjoys being of service to them.
