# Honest, Accessible Government

Wes believes that the public treasury is for the public and not up for grabs by special interests.

Whether filling vacancies, performing internal audits, or confirming the integrity of appointments, Wes will uphold the values of honesty and fairness.

Wes will seek out opportunities to keep the public in the loop and to meet regularly with them.

# City Planning

Housing prices vastly exceed most people’s wages, and many properties are being bought as an investment rather than a residence, excluding many citizens in-state who need a place to live. A lack of affordable housing with access to public transportation is a major factor in our rates of poverty and homelessness.

Our citizens like and prefer meaningful public spaces in which to gather. Public parks should be prominent throughout our cities and not treated as afterthoughts.

Sidewalks, crossing guards and plowing services should be maintained and bolstered throughout our cities, particularly in our unincorporated areas.

# The Common Good

Wes would like to look into providing safe, affordable childcare facilities that are open at later hours for families with varying work schedules.

Recreational centers and libraries are essential and beloved community gathering places that provide access to education, recreation, culture, childcare, food and clothing. Their facilities and programs should be given support and respect.

Animal shelters in our county do important work but are often underfunded and operate apart from one another. Wes would like to explore ways to bring them together and maintain high standards of accountability and care.

# Our Working Class

Our county features many valuable public resources and programs for refugees and low-income families. We should make these resources easier to navigate and use.

Individuals and families in poverty often experience the so-called [“Cliff Effect”](https://www.circlesusa.org/research/cliff-effect/) when a raise or a promotion leads to a swift drop-off in qualifying for public benefits programs. They are in effect making too much for public assistance but not nearly enough to make ends meet. Benefit ”cliffs” should be located within our programs and adjusted so that the sharp cliff becomes a smooth and gradual ramp.
